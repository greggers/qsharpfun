# Quantum Computing with Q#

## Overview
This repository contains my journey into **Quantum Computing** using **Q#**, Microsoft's quantum programming language. I'm working through the official tutorials on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/qsharp-quickstart) and documenting my progress along the way.

## Why Q#?
Q# is a domain-specific language designed for expressing quantum algorithms. It is part of the **Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)** and integrates with tools like **Azure Quantum** and **Jupyter Notebooks**, allowing developers to experiment with quantum algorithms using simulators and real quantum hardware.

## Repository Contents
- **Basic Quantum Gates**: Implementations of quantum gates such as Hadamard, Pauli, and CNOT.
- **Quantum Superposition and Entanglement**: Examples demonstrating qubit states, Bell states, and entanglement.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Implementations of Grover’s and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms.
- **Quantum Simulations**: Running quantum circuits on local and cloud-based quantum simulators.
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Solutions to exercises from Microsoft’s Q# tutorials.

## How to Run the Code
### Prerequisites
- Install the **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)**
- Set up **Q# Jupyter Notebooks** or use the **Q# command-line interface**
- Optionally, install **Visual Studio Code** or **Visual Studio** for enhanced Q# development

### Running a Q# Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qsharp-tutorials.git
   cd qsharp-tutorials
   ```
2. Open a Q# script (`.qs`) in Visual Studio Code or execute it via command line:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
3. For Jupyter Notebook users:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open a `.ipynb` file and run the cells.
